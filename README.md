Basic leaderboard example on steroids

I wanted to take Meteor for a quick spin and this learboard example was the first project the team recommended on their website.

The team also suggested that newbs extend the example by adding a bit of additional functionality- which I did. 

Meteor looks like an AWESOME framework. However, it is still very young and doesn't have many projects working with it at scale.

I will continue to monitor the progress and may revisit it as it matures.
